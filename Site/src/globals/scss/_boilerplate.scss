  Pardon the dust! I hope you don't mind, but I don't get a lot of 
  time to spend working on my own projects, so I hope this single-pager 
  is enough to start our conversation!

  Please, shoot me a message @ randy@randyhammons.com, 
  I'd love to chat about collaborating on fun and exciting work!
